# Default configuration file for the model weighting script.
#
# --- *IMPORTANT* ---
# Please don't change anything here but rather:
# 'cp config_default.ini config.ini' (note that config.ini is the default config name
# model_weighting.py will look for)
# open config.ini and set save_path and plot_path to writable directories as well as
# you should now be able to run 'python model_weighting.py' (without any arguments)
# -------------------

# To create a new section just add at the end
# > [new_section]
# All variables not set in [new_section] will be take from [DEFAULT]
# Run the new section: 'python model_weighting.py new_section'

# You can also create a completely new config, with new [DEFAULT] and run it like:
# 'python model_weighting.py -f config_new.ini' (runs [DEFAULT])
# 'python model_weighting.py section_name -f config_new.ini' (runs [section_name])

# --- *NOTE* ---
# If config_default.ini/[DEFAULT] is updated on the master you will have to merge
# the updates in your config.ini manually after pulling. E.g., by running
# 'meld config_default.ini config.ini'
